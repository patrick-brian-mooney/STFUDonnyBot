"""Twitter recently announced that their normal rules about bullying and civility
don't apply to the accounts of world leaders, this bot tests whether those
rules are also interpreted differently for people speaking back to bullying
world leaders. In order to test this, it says something that, though perhaps
not civil, is certainly something that needs to be said much more often.

That is, STFUDonnyBot is a bot that waits for @realDonaldTrump to tweet, then
replies with an image GIF of Walter Sobchek saying 'Shut the fuck up, Donny.'
